This is a placeholder for the actual PDF resume file.

In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual PDF resume file named "alex-morgan-resume.pdf".

The resume would typically include:
- Contact information
- Professional summary
- Work experience
- Education
- Certifications (CISSP, CEH, CompTIA Security+)
- Technical skills
- Projects
- References

Note: Since we can't create an actual PDF file in this environment, this text file serves as a placeholder. 
In a real implementation, you would need to replace this with a properly formatted PDF resume.
