## Deployment to Vercel

This portfolio is configured for deployment on Vercel. Follow these steps to deploy:

1. Create a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) if you don't have one already.
2. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `vercel login` and follow the prompts to log in.
5. Run `vercel` to deploy the project.
6. Follow the prompts to configure your deployment.
7. Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL to access your portfolio.

### Troubleshooting 404 Errors

If you encounter 404 errors after deployment, check the following:

1. Make sure all file paths in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are correct.
2. Ensure that all referenced files exist in the project.
3. Check that the `vercel.json` file is properly configured.
4. Verify that the `404.html` file exists in the root directory.
5. Try running `vercel --prod` to deploy directly to production.

### Important Vercel Deployment Notes

1. **Simplified Configuration**: We're using a minimal `vercel.json` file with just the version specified to avoid configuration conflicts.

2. **Direct Deployment Method**: For the most reliable deployment, use the Vercel web interface:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in
   - Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository or upload the folder directly
   - Use the default settings without modifications
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:
   - If you encounter issues, try removing any `.vercel` directory in your project
   - Make sure you don't have both `vercel.json` and `now.json` files
   - Avoid having both `.vercelignore` and `.nowignore` files
   - Try deploying without any configuration files and let Vercel use its defaults

4. **Clean Project Structure**: Ensure your project has a clean structure with:
   - `index.html` in the root directory
   - All assets properly referenced with relative paths
   - No empty files that might cause build issues
