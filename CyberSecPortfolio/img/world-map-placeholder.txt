This is a placeholder for a world map image.
In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual image file (e.g., PNG, SVG, or JPG) 
that contains a stylized world map for the threat map visualization in the security dashboard section.
The map would serve as a background for displaying global cybersecurity threat points.
